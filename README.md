# Frontend Take-Home Assignment: Sanctioned Address Monitor

A production-ready React & TypeScript foundation for monitoring Ethereum address balances. Your task is to extend this application with advanced features as outlined in `TAKE_HOME.md`.

## Assignment Overview

This project provides a complete, working application that includes professional-grade architecture, error handling, and user interface. You'll build upon this foundation to demonstrate your frontend engineering skills.

**See `TAKE_HOME.md` for your specific assignment tasks.**

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js ≥ 20.19.0
- npm or yarn

### Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Environment Setup (Optional)
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
# Etherscan API Key (optional - get from https://etherscan.io/apis)
VITE_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Current Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Framework**: React 19 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.x + shadcn/ui components  
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state, TanStack Query for server state
- **API Client**: Axios with retry logic and error handling
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Build Tool**: Vite 7
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier + Husky

### What's Already Implemented
- **Clean Architecture**: Domain-driven structure with TypeScript
- **API Integration**: ETH balance and price fetching with retry logic
- **Professional UI**: shadcn/ui components with responsive design
- **Performance**: Optimized queries, caching, and error boundaries
- **Testing Setup**: Complete test infrastructure ready for use
- **Developer Experience**: Linting, formatting, type checking
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, semantic HTML, keyboard navigation

## Development

### Available Scripts
```bash

npm run build        # Build for production
npm run preview      # Preview production build
npm run lint         # Lint code
npm run lint:fix     # Fix linting issues
npm run type-check   # Check TypeScript types
npm run format       # Format code with Prettier
npm run format:check # Check code formatting
```

## Current Features

The base application includes:

1. **Address Balance Monitoring**: Real-time ETH balance fetching for sanctioned addresses
2. **Price Integration**: Live ETH/USD price data from Etherscan
3. **Exposure Calculation**: Total USD exposure across all addresses
4. **Professional UI**: Card-based layout with status indicators
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and retry logic
6. **Loading States**: Loading spinners and visual feedback
7. **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
8. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with strict types

## Your Mission

**See `TAKE_HOME.md` for detailed assignment instructions.**

You'll choose 3 features to implement, such as:
- Dynamic address management with persistence
- Advanced data table with pagination and sorting
- Real-time dashboard enhancements
- Performance optimizations and caching
- Comprehensive theme system
- Testing excellence demonstration

## Submission

1. **Implement your chosen features** following the existing code quality standards
2. **Document your decisions** in `DECISIONS.md`
3. **Update this README** with your new features
4. **Include tests** for any new functionality

## Success Tips

- **Build upon the existing foundation** - don't reinvent what's working
- **Focus on code quality** - match the professional standards already established
- **Consider performance** - your changes should enhance, not degrade performance
- **Think about UX** - small details make a big difference
- **Document decisions** - explain your technical choices

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
All configuration is centralized in `src/config/env.ts` with validation and defaults.

### TypeScript
Strict configuration with path mapping (`@/*` imports) and comprehensive type checking.

### Code Quality
- Pre-commit hooks automatically lint and format code
- Comprehensive ESLint rules for React and TypeScript
- Prettier for consistent formatting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Node Version**: Ensure Node.js ≥ 20.19.0
- **API Rate Limits**: Add Etherscan API key to `.env`
- **Build Errors**: Run `npm run type-check` to identify TypeScript issues

### New Features Added

#### 1. Dynamic Address Management
- **Add Address Form**: Interactive dialog with Ethereum address validation using Zod.
- **Remove Address**: Delete functionality for existing addresses with a secure confirmation step using `AlertDialog`. 
- **Robust Validation**: Enforces valid Ethereum address formats (regex and length) and prevents duplicate entries (case-insensitive).
- **UX Polish**: Responsive design (mobile-first), accessible focus management, and keyboard navigation support.

#### 2. Testing & Quality Excellence
- **Comprehensive Hook Testing**: Robust test coverage for `useBalance`, `usePrice`, and `useAddAddressForm` handling success, loading, retry logic, and error states.
- **Component Unit Tests**: Isolated testing of UI components including `ExposurePage`, `AddressCard`, and `AddAddressDialog`.
- **Integration User Flows**: End-to-end integration tests using MSW (Mock Service Worker) to verify complex interactions like adding an address and seeing it reflected in the dashboard.
- **Error Handling**: Thorough testing suite with verification of API failure modes, custom retry logic (up to 3 times), and UI recovery states.

#### 3. Architecture & Refactoring
- **State Decoupling**: Extracted global state into dedicated stores (`src/stores`) for better testability and separation of concerns.
- **Performance Optimized**: Refactored address monitoring to use `useQueries` for efficient batch fetching and isolated `AddressCard` components to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- **Type-Safe Validation**: Integrated Zod for schema-based validation across forms and API responses.
